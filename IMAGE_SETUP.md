# Image Setup Instructions

## Add Your Photo

To display your photo in the circular frame:

1. **Get your photo** - Choose a nice photo of you and your girlfriend together
2. **Rename it to**: `couple.jpg`
3. **Place it in**: `c:\Users\Akash\OneDrive\Desktop\15 feb\`
4. **Recommended**: Use a square photo for best results (will be cropped to circle)

The photo will automatically:
- Display in a circular frame
- Have a rotating gradient border (gold → orange → purple)
- Scale to fit perfectly with object-fit: cover
- Show with a glowing effect

## Current Setup

- Music file: `mp 3.mp3` ✅ (already added)
- Image file: `couple.jpg` ❌ (needs to be added)

## Alternative

If you don't have a photo ready, you can:
1. Use any image you like
2. Rename it to `couple.jpg`
3. Or edit `index.html` line 143 to use a different filename

The image will look beautiful in the rotating gradient circle! 🎨
