## Troubleshooting

**If you don't see your repository:**
- Make sure you're logged in with the same GitHub account
- Click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions" to give Vercel access
- Refresh the page

**If deployment fails:**
- Check the build logs
- Usually it auto-detects correctly for static sites

## After Deployment

- Your site will be live at: `https://15feb-[random].vercel.app`
- You can add a custom domain later
- Any future pushes to GitHub will auto-deploy!
